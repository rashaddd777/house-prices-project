# House Prices Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the final sale prices of residential homes in Ames, Iowa using the Ames Housing dataset. The project demonstrates a complete data science pipelineâ€”from data exploration and cleaning to feature engineering, model building, hyperparameter tuning, ensemble modeling, evaluation, and submission preparation.


## How to Run the Project

1. **Set Up the Environment:**
   - Install Python 3.10 (or a compatible version).
   - Create and activate a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python3.10 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Run the Notebooks:**
   - Begin with `01_data_exploration.ipynb` and proceed sequentially:
     - Data Exploration
     - Data Cleaning
     - Feature Engineering
     - Baseline Modeling
     - Hyperparameter Tuning
     - Ensemble Modeling
     - Final Evaluation
     - Submission Preparation

3. **Modules:**
   - Reusable code is maintained in the `src/` directory. Import these modules as needed in your notebooks.

4. **Reports:**
   - All figures are saved in `reports/figures` and text outputs in `reports/text`.

## Project Goals & Outcomes

- Develop a robust predictive model for house prices.
- Demonstrate proficiency in data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
- Create a reproducible and modular codebase that can be extended or updated easily.

## Submission

- The final submission file (`submission.csv`) is generated by `08_submission_preparation.ipynb` and should follow the competition format (columns: `Id` and `SalePrice`).
